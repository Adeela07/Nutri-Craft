##  General info
### Motivation
In today's world, a growing awareness of health and well-being is driving individuals to make conscious lifestyle choices. While avoiding unhealthy foods and engaging in regular exercise are important, achieving a truly healthy lifestyle requires a balanced diet that is tailored to individual needs. A well-balanced diet, customized based on factors like height, weight, and age, can be the cornerstone of a healthier life. When combined with physical activity, a proper diet can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease, and enhance overall well-being. However, readily available and personalized tools for diet recommendation are still limited, particularly solutions that take into account individual nutritional needs. This gap motivated the development of a content-based diet recommendation system using machine learning in this project. 
### What is a food recommendation engine?
Our food recommendation engine uses a content-based approach to provide personalized dietary suggestions. By analyzing the nutritional content and ingredients of recipes, it recommends options tailored to individual dietary needs, preferences, and restrictions. This system helps users make healthier choices, discover new nutritious foods, and create a well-rounded, sustainable diet, ultimately contributing to better long-term health outcomes. Our application provides personalized meal plans based on specific nutritional goals and preferences, showing detailed nutritional values, ingredients, instructions and a preview image of each recommended recipe.
