This project introduces a machine learning-based food and diet recommendation system designed to promote healthy eating habits and personalized dietary guidance 

## :scroll: General info
### Motivation
In today's world, a growing awareness of health and well-being is driving individuals to make conscious lifestyle choices. While avoiding unhealthy foods and engaging in regular exercise are important, achieving a truly healthy lifestyle requires a balanced diet that is tailored to individual needs. A well-balanced diet, customized based on factors like height, weight, and age, can be the cornerstone of a healthier life. When combined with physical activity, a proper diet can help achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases like cancer and heart disease, and enhance overall well-being. However, readily available and personalized tools for diet recommendation are still limited, particularly solutions that take into account individual nutritional needs. This gap motivated the development of a content-based diet recommendation system using machine learning in this project. 
### What is a food recommendation engine?
Our food recommendation engine, employing a content-based approach, is designed to empower users to make informed and healthy dietary choices. This system analyzes the nutritional content and ingredients of various recipes, providing personalized recommendations based on this analysis. A key advantage of this method is its ability to respect individual dietary requirements and preferences. Users can specify their nutritional goals, such as limiting fat or increasing protein intake, and the system will recommend foods that align with those specific targets, while also accommodating ingredient preferences or restrictions. By offering tailored suggestions, our engine helps users make better choices and improve their overall health. Furthermore, by recommending a variety of healthy recipes, it encourages dietary exploration, helping users discover new and nutritious options, overcome food boredom, and ultimately build a well-rounded and sustainable diet, which has a positive and long-term impact on their health outcomes. Our project offers personalized meal plans based on the user's specified nutritional values, including meal compositions and nutritional values of the recommended recipes. The final output is a set of tailored recipes which includes the nutritional values, ingredients, instructions and a preview image, to help them adopt a balanced and healthier way of life.
